Bug Tracker is a C++ Command Line Application with Database connection using MySQL.
It enables users to report, view, and manage bugs efficiently. It features user authentication, data persistence, and allows bugs to be marked as fixed. 
Built with OOP principles, demonstrates real-world problem-solving in C++.
The database is named bugtrackerdb, and it contains two tables: 'users' and 'bugs'.
The 'users' table stores usernames and passwords, while the 'bugs' table stores bug ID, description, status ('Open' or 'Fixed'), and the timestamp of each report.
